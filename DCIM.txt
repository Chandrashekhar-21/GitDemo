Table Fields should highlight if entered a wrong data in it ? 
Table field should have asterisk beside the mandatory field

On hovering over String logo should show home logo label - so user will get to know  that can redirect to home page 

On Landing sceen : user can not redirect to SRP FUND B if try to go through menu - Fund- Fund B  


Above tab name should be shown on the page header once landed/redirect on these sceen like Conti,Budget Summary,About us page 
User will get to know on which page currently he is 


Loan Details : Hedging :  No success message is shown after adding a valid data 
Hedging : 
Swap rate : add this value : 40820985428 and save it 
Try delete these values : Does not allow to delete it using backspace , To delete : need to select all the values, delete it 

Using ESC key, can not close the edit table mode 


Add loan page : 
Can not navigate using tab button or select the dropdown on add loan
Add loan/Add loan ledger : Auto Focus issue on the pop up field and tab key does not work on these pop up 
Save button should be right side, might be chanches that user may click on cancel while saving the loan as it just below the fields 

Good : 
Able to seach the proeprty using all details 
Website is responsive 

Issue : suppose we have table that has no values in it and if try to update those value then we get the pop up, nothing to update,
so we cant check the table valuse 
so we have to arrange those test cases acordingly like 1. after performing update scenario, we have perform the null test case execution 

No data available is showing once we landed on any page, instead it should show fetching the data 
once client knows the data is not on the server then it should show, No data is available
